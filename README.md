# Scala Blackjack

Welcome to **Scala Blackjack**, a console-based simulation of the popular card game Blackjack.

## Rules

- The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
- Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever is more beneficial to the player.
- The dealer will hit (draw a card) until their hand totals 17 or more points.
- If the player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the round.
- If both the player and the dealer stand (stop drawing cards), the hand closest to 21 wins.

## Technologies

- **Scala**: The primary programming language used.
- **sbt (Scala Build Tool)**: For compiling and running the project.
